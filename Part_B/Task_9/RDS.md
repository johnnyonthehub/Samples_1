##a.  Selected Database Software: PostgresSQL

Sakila is a small to medium-sized business with around 600 international customer and staff records.  As with all small-to-medium sized companies, it's important that any business software solutions are <mark>scalable</mark>.  Cost is also a consideration, as they'll want a solid return on investment.  

With a limited number of staff, the solution needs to be <mark>well-documented, reliable, stable, and come with good product support</mark>. It's very likely that none of the staff are proficient in database management and none would have the time to take full ownership of the task.  So, the chosen software needs to be <mark>user-friendly</mark> as well.

Security is another consideration. Ideally, several layers of <mark>enryption</mark> should be available to prevent exploitation of the database.

I would recommend an open-source solution that allows the company to customise it to their unique needs. 

There are a few open-source solutions to consider.  These include MySQL, MariaDB, PostgresSQL, MongoDB, Cockroach etc.
Taking into account all of the above considerations and the added benefits of <mark>Python compatibility</mark>, a <mark>geolocation engine</mark> (handy for a business with international customers), and product support via updates and a large community of users,
I've selected ,<mark>PostgresSQL</mark> as my database of choice.
